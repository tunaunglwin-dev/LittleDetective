# design.md — Sone Dauk Lay

**Version:** 4.1 · Companion to `PRD_San_Dauk_Lay_v3.md`, `spec_lens_and_lectures.md`, `wireframes_v2.html`
**Scope:** visual system for three modules — Learn, Play, the Lens — plus the printed deck.

**Changed in v4:** palette replaced with the green system actually built (§3) · monospace given a defined job (§5) · Module C, the Lens (§9) · video & audio lecture components (§8.4) · "correct" is no longer a colour (§3).
**Changed in v4.1** (from `/plan-design-review` on the Mission Map, 2026-07-24): added §7.1 Mission Map · added §3 sub-rule generalizing illustration-vs-score · fixed the padlock/§14 conflict (see §7.1).

## 1. What this product looks like, and why

San Dauk Lay is a **little detective**, not a security console. The audience includes people nervous about technology who have been burned by it; anything resembling a threat dashboard — red alerts, percentage gauges, warning triangles — makes them feel accused rather than equipped.

The direction is **a field notebook, not an antivirus scanner.** Soft paper, ink, a highlighter, hand-annotated evidence, and a friendly magnifier who does the looking with you.

The built landing page settles the register: **pale green, rounded type, a smiling lens.** That warmth is doing real work — it is what separates this from every security product the audience has been frightened by. Protect it. When a decision is ambiguous, choose the warmer option.

Three constraints drive every decision, in order:

1. **Burmese is primary.** Latin is the gloss. Type decisions start from Myanmar script.
2. **A budget Android in daylight.** High contrast, large targets, no thin weights.
3. **Under 500 KB, usable on 3G, functional offline.** This is why lectures stream and never bundle, and why illustration is SVG/CSS, never raster (see §7.1).

## 2. The three modules

```
                 HOME
    ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
  LEARN           PLAY          THE LENS
 casebook        the game       companion
  daylight       evening         overlay
    └──────────────┼──────────────┘
              SHARED SPINE
   six techniques · one scenario pool
   the tell · mastery progress · the deck
```

Learn and Play are **destinations**. The Lens is an **overlay** — it has no home screen and no tab, only the corner magnifier present on every screen. That difference must be visible: destinations own the full screen; the Lens always sits on top of something else, because it assists rather than instructs.

**Rules that keep three modules from becoming three products:**

- **One vocabulary.** The same six techniques, same Burmese labels, same tells — in lessons, rounds, Lens replies, and printed cards. No module introduces a term the others don't use.
- **One scenario pool.** Authored once, available to a lesson, a round, and a card.
- **One progress model.** All three feed the same mastery states.
- **The bridge is mandatory.** A lesson's beat 4 launches a real game round (§8.3).

## 3. Colour

The green system as built. Green is the **brand**, which means green cannot also mean "correct" — a signal that matches the background signals nothing.

| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--mist` | `#E9F1EA` | Page background |
| `--surface` | `#FFFFFF` | Cards, sheets, reading surfaces |
| `--sage` | `#85B491` | The mascot, illustration fill, Lens accents |
| `--sage-soft` | `#D3E5D7` | Selected chips, user bubbles, subtle fills |
| `--forest` | `#2C4433` | Play chrome, secondary dark surfaces |
| `--ink` | `#1B2A1F` | Primary text, primary buttons |
| `--muted` | `#6B7D6F` | Secondary text, labels (min 13px — never smaller) |
| `--hairline` | `#CFDDD2` | Borders, dividers |

**Functional colours — only two, and neither is green:**

| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--amber` | `#C8871F` | **The highlighter.** Marks the tell and the evidence fragment. Nothing else. |
| `--amber-soft` | `#FBEFD8` | Highlight background behind a tell |
| `--clay` | `#B0453F` | Manipulation technique markers, Villain's Seat watermark |

**Correctness has no colour.** Genuine content, correct answers, and completed states are marked by **icon and word only** (`✓ genuine`, `named`). This is deliberate: it keeps the palette to two functional hues, and it stops the interface from turning into a scoreboard of right and wrong.

**Track accents** — 3px rules on track headers and lesson cards only. Never fills, never text colour.

| Track | Token | Hex |
|---|---|---|
| 1 · Techniques | `--track-1` | `#2C4433` |
| 2 · AI & synthetic media | `--track-2` | `#5A5A7A` |
| 3 · Information integrity | `--track-3` | `#2C6068` |
| 4 · Act | `--track-4` | `#8A5A3B` |

**Rules**

- **Never colour-only.** Technique identity, genuine/manipulated, module identity, track identity must each carry an icon or word as well. ~8% of men have red-green colour blindness and this content is safety-relevant.
- **`--clay` marks the manipulation, never the person's mistake.** A wrong answer gets neutral treatment plus the explanation.
- **No risk tiers.** v1's green/yellow/red is gone with the score it encoded. There are named techniques, not threat levels.
- Contrast floor **4.5:1** text, **3:1** interactive boundaries. Verify in sunlight, not on a desk monitor — `--muted` on `--mist` is the pairing most likely to fail.

### 3.1 Illustration vs. score — the general rule

*(Added v4.1, generalized from the Mission Map review. Applies everywhere, not just Play.)*

Game-like presentation is not banned; **accumulable numeric display** is. Apply this mechanical test to any new visual element:

> **Does it render a number, token, currency, or fill-meter the user is meant to watch go up?**
> If yes — banned, no matter what it's called. Renaming "points" to "mastery %" or "XP" to "insight" does not launder it.
> If no — it's dressing, and dressing is allowed, even encouraged.

Concretely:

| Allowed (dressing — adds *place*) | Banned (score — adds *number*) |
|---|---|
| Illustrated terrain, a path, character presence, chapter framing | Any "`N/M`" or "`⭐ N`" counter |
| A qualitative, skill-derived title ("Detective Rookie" → "Master Detective") | A currency or gem counter |
| An object that *represents* a milestone (a drawn case file, a closed folder) | A reward object gated behind a numeric threshold ("open the chest at 30 XP") |
| One-time celebration on crossing a real mastery threshold | A live counter, a streak, a timer, a leaderboard |

This is the same test that already justified §6's "no badges, streaks, points, timers, or confetti" — §3.1 exists so implementers have a *test*, not just a list of banned nouns, when a new feature invents a new kind of visual.

## 4. Module identity — one palette, re-weighted

| | **Learn** | **Play** | **Lens** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Register | Daylight — reading | Evening — casework | A companion leaning in |
| Chrome | `--mist` header, `--ink` text | `--forest` header, reversed | Sheet over whatever's beneath |
| Content surface | `--surface` | `--surface` | `--surface` |
| Accent role | Amber marks the tell | Amber marks evidence | Sage marks the companion |
| Density | Airy, generous | Tighter | Conversational |

**Play is not a dark theme.** Forest appears in headers, nav, and mode cards only. Content surfaces stay light, because budget Androids in daylight need the contrast and scenario cards must look like real messages — a dark scenario card breaks the realism the whole See step depends on.

---

## 5. Typography

```css
--font-display: "Poppins", "Nunito", system-ui, sans-serif;  /* subset, headings only */
--font-body:    -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;
--font-mono:    ui-monospace, "SF Mono", Menlo, Consolas, monospace;
--font-mm:      "Padauk", "Noto Sans Myanmar", "Myanmar Text", sans-serif;
```

**Three faces, three jobs.** The rounded display face is what makes the product feel friendly rather than clinical — it is a deliberate choice and worth its cost, but **subset it to headings only** (~20 KB). Body text uses the system stack; Roboto ships on every Android target and buys back ~180 KB.

**Monospace has a defined job**, established by the landing page and now codified: mono is **the system speaking about itself.** Eyebrow labels, meta-statements, and honesty disclosures — *"no account needed · nothing is uploaded · works offline."* It reads as an evidence label in a case file, which fits the metaphor exactly.

Mono is therefore the correct face for the Lens's *"what I can't know"* block (§9.5). Never use mono for content the user is meant to learn from — only for the interface being candid about itself.

**Burmese** uses Padauk or Noto Sans Myanmar throughout — self-hosted, regular and semibold only, hinted woff2. Padauk is also the **print** face.

### Burmese rules — functional requirements, not preferences

- **Line-height 1.7–1.8 minimum.** Myanmar script has tall ascenders and stacked medials; Latin's 1.4–1.5 clips diacritics. Reserve this in every layout from the start.
- **No italics.** Myanmar script has no italic form; browsers synthesise a broken oblique. Emphasise with weight or `--amber-soft`.
- **No all-caps, no letter-spacing.** Meaningless in Myanmar script, and letter-spacing breaks conjunct rendering. *(This is why mono eyebrows are Latin-only.)*
- **Minimum 16px** Burmese body; 14px acceptable for Latin.
- **Never truncate Burmese mid-word with ellipsis.** Word boundaries aren't space-marked as in Latin; truncation produces nonsense. Wrap, or clip whole lines.
- Test every string at **360×640, low DPI** — the realistic device floor.

### Scale

| Role | Latin | Burmese | Face | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hero / screen title | 22px | 24px / 1.7 | display | 600 |
| Eyebrow / meta | 11px | — | **mono** | 400 |
| Body | 15px | 16px / 1.75 | body | 400 |
| **The tell** | 16px | 18px / 1.8 | body | 500 |
| Technique name | 15px | 17px | body | 600 |
| Caption | 13px | 14px | body | 400 |

### Long-form reading (Learn only)

- **Measure 28–36 Burmese characters per line.** Myanmar script is denser and taller; the Latin 45–75 rule produces exhausting lines. Cap the reader column on wider screens.
- **Line-height 1.8** for prose. Paragraph spacing 1.2em, **no first-line indent** — indents are a Latin print convention and read as an error in Burmese digital text.
- **Maximum 3 paragraphs per beat screen.** More means the lesson is too long; split or cut.
- **No justified text** — Myanmar script lacks the spacing flexibility and justification produces rivers.
- **Bold one phrase per paragraph maximum.** Myanmar semibold is visually heavier than Latin bold.
- **No English translation under body prose.** Gloss the tell and technique names only; translating prose doubles the load for bilingual readers and helps nobody.

## 6. Shared spine components

**Scenario card** — must read as a believable message, not a quiz item. Mimics its source platform closely enough to be recognisable, with a persistent unobtrusive `example` marker in mono. `--surface`, 8px radius, hairline border. Identical across Learn, Play, the Lens, and print.

**Technique chip** — bilingual, Burmese primary. Selected: `--sage-soft` fill, `--forest` border, **plus a checkmark**. Minimum 44×44px, 48px preferred.

**The tell panel** — the product's most important component. `--amber-soft` background, 3px `--amber` left rule, Burmese first, Latin gloss below. One sentence; if it needs two, it isn't finished. 32px clearance above and below — it earns the space.

**Evidence highlight** — inline `--amber-soft` behind the exact fragment doing the manipulating, annotation beneath in `--clay`. The signature move: show the mechanism *inside* the message, not beside it.

**Vote buttons** — trust / not sure / doubt, equal weight, never pre-selected. Styling "doubt" as the safe choice trains reflexive suspicion, which is the failure mode this whole product designs against.

**Progress** — measured in **techniques nameable**: *not met · met · practised · named across contexts.* Never lessons completed, rounds played, minutes, or streaks. All three modules feed one model.

**No badges, streaks, points, timers, or confetti.** They reward return visits over retained skill and read as juvenile to the adult half of the audience. (See §3.1 for the general test this implies.)

---

## 7. Play module components

**Mode cards** on `--forest` chrome: *Solo case* · *Villain's Seat* (locked until one round is complete — the lock **explains itself**, never just greys out) · *Table mode* (an equal, not a fallback).

**Round progress** — segmented bar, one segment per scenario, filled segments carrying a technique glyph so the bar doubles as a record. **No timer**: time pressure teaches guessing.

**Score** — shown only at round end, never live. A live counter pulls attention from the message to the number. The summary reports, in order: techniques named · techniques missed (neutral, each routing to its lesson) · **genuine messages you trusted**. That last line is a score line *on purpose* — correctly trusting real content is a skill, and displaying it is how the design resists training paranoia.

**Villain's Seat** — full-width `--clay` band plus diagonal repeating `GAME CONTENT` pattern behind the compose field, visible in any screenshot; selection, copy, and share disabled; slot-filled from curated fragments; no real people, brands, working URLs, or payment handles; every round closes back to defence.

### 7.1 Mission Map (added v4.1)

The level-select screen for Play. Approved direction from `/plan-design-review`,
2026-07-24 — mockup at
`~/.gstack/projects/tunaunglwin-dev-LittleDetective/designs/mission-map-restyle-20260724/mockup-middle-path.png`.

**What it is:** a screen that feels like *a place*, not a settings list — without
becoming a scoreboard. Levels gate on real mastery (`levelUnlocked()`), never on
a point total.

- **Trail** — a winding, hand-drawn-style dotted SVG path (not a straight line)
  connecting the level nodes. Inline SVG only, `stroke-dasharray`, no raster asset.
- **Platform icons** — each level gets a custom small inline SVG icon at its node
  (e.g. a magnifier-ring, a stack of case-files, a closed case-file box),
  matching the greyscale-safe style already used for `TechniqueIcon` (§12). Not a
  plain numbered circle.
- **Unlocked-card weight** — the single playable level gets `--sage-soft` fill and
  a `--forest` 2px border so it visually wins the scan immediately; locked cards
  stay `--surface` / hairline / 65% opacity. (Reuses the existing "selected"
  treatment from Technique chip §6 — no new token.)
- **Locked state icon — NOT a padlock.** §14 already bans padlock/shield/siren
  iconography as security-console framing; the Mission Map must not reintroduce
  it. Use a dim, dashed-outline rendering of the level's *own* platform icon
  instead — "not yet," not "locked out."
- **Chapter mascot** — the existing `Mascot` component rendered larger on this
  screen only (reuse its `float`/`ring` props, same as the HQ hero), with a small
  drawn vignette ring. Same magnifier character, more presence — never a
  different character, never 3D/raster art.
- **Unlock moment** — when a level newly unlocks, animate that one node on
  return to the map (existing `anim-rise`/`pop` keyframes — dissolve from the dim
  "not yet" icon to its full unlocked platform treatment). This is the map's own
  "something changed" signal, distinct from the rank-up modal.
- **No numeric display anywhere on this screen** — no `N/M`, no star count, no
  gem/currency counter, no treasure-chest-as-reward. Apply §3.1's test to any
  future addition here.
- **Palette stays green.** No purple, no palette swap for this screen — the
  magnifier mascot appears on Home, the header, and the Lens; a different
  palette/character here fractures brand identity rather than creating a themed
  sub-world.
- **Budget:** everything on this screen is inline SVG/CSS. Zero new raster
  assets — this is a hard constraint, not a preference, on an offline-first,
  budget-Android, Myanmar-bandwidth target (§1).
- **Accessibility:** trail and platform-icon SVGs are decorative — `aria-hidden="true"`.
  All real semantics (level name, lock state, unlock requirement) live in the
  existing text/button markup. SVGs use `viewBox` so they scale rather than
  needing separate mobile art. Verified at 360×640 (§5 floor).

## 8. Learn module components

**8.1 Track header** — 3px track-accent rule, track name, lesson count, mastery state (`4 of 6 practised`). No ring, no percentage.

**8.2 Lesson card** — `--surface`, 8px radius, 3px track-accent left rule. Burmese title 17px/600, English gloss 13px `--muted`, one-word state. **No duration estimate** — "4 min" invites people to decide they haven't got 4 minutes.

**8.3 Beats** — five, one per screen, five-segment bar at top. **Tap-forward only, no swipe** (unreliable on cheap touchscreens; collides with Android back-gestures).

| Beat | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Meet it | Full-bleed scenario on `--mist`. No chrome, no title — the scenario is the whole screen. |
| How it works | `--surface`, prose column, §5 reading rules. The only long-reading screen in the product. |
| The tell | The tell panel alone, centred, generous space. |
| **Practice** | **Launches a real game round** — Play chrome, no lesson framing, no "practice mode" badge, no reduced scoring. Returns to beat 5 automatically. **If this bridge is cut for scope, cut the Learn module with it.** |
| Carry it | `--forest` reversed, one sentence, 20px/1.8, copy button. The **only** copyable text in the product — deliberately opposite to Build output, and the difference must be legible at a glance. |

**8.4 Lecture affordance (video & audio)** — attaches to **beat 2 only**, never replacing it.

- A single row **above** the prose: static thumbnail (no embedded player until tapped — players cost KB), `▶ Watch · 90s` and `♪ Listen` in mono, `--muted`.
- **No autoplay, ever.** On a metered connection, tapping shows an estimated size first.
- The text lesson is already on screen beneath it, so **a failed video has no error state** — there is no dependency to break.
- Audio player is a single hairline bar: play/pause, scrub, elapsed. No waveform, no artwork.
- **A lesson is never video-only.** Text is the path; lectures are enrichment.

---

## 9. The Lens (Module C)

### 9.1 The corner magnifier
56px mascot, bottom-right, 16px inset, sitting above any nav. Present on every screen.

- States: **idle** (neutral smile) · **thinking** (slow single pulse) · **has reply** (small `--sage` dot). Nothing else. No loops.
- **Never auto-opens. Never nags.** One contextual invitation is permitted — after a missed technique: *"Want to look at that one together?"* — dismissible permanently, never repeated.
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` by dropping the pulse entirely.

### 9.2 The sheet
Opens to ~70% height over the current screen; the screen beneath stays visible and dimmed. The mascot shrinks to a 32px sheet header. Dismisses back into the corner. Context persists within a session, clears on close.

The Lens **always sits on top of something**. It never becomes a full screen, because it assists rather than instructs — and the layering is what communicates that.

### 9.3 Turns — asymmetric on purpose
- **User:** `--sage-soft` bubble, right-aligned, 16px radius.
- **The Lens:** **no bubble.** Plain text on `--surface`, left-aligned.

This asymmetry is deliberate. Bubbles on both sides read as two friends chatting; the Lens is the notebook thinking out loud, not a companion to confide in. It quietly discourages the parasocial framing that a mascot otherwise invites, and it costs nothing to implement.

### 9.4 Suggested replies
The Lens's Socratic questions carry 2–3 tappable answer chips (`--sage-soft`, 44px minimum). Typing Burmese on a budget phone is slow; the chips are what make the conversation usable for the target audience. Free text stays available underneath.

### 9.5 The "what I can't know" block
The signature component of the Lens, and always the last thing in a reply.

- Hairline box, `--surface`, **mono type**, `--muted`.
- Ties honesty to the system voice already established by the landing page.
- Given real space — it is a feature, not a footnote or a disclaimer.
- Never collapsed, never behind a "more" link, never smaller than 13px.

**Technique results inside the Lens reuse the standard technique card and tell panel** from §6 without modification. Consistency across surfaces is exactly what makes the vocabulary portable off the app.

### 9.6 Escalation mode
When escalation triggers (money already sent, crisis language, someone in danger), the Lens **changes mode completely**:

- **No mascot, no chat bubbles, no techniques, no lesson framing.**
- A single high-contrast `--surface` card: what to do, in order, in plain Burmese. Phone numbers as large tap targets.
- Calm, not alarmed. No `--clay`, no warning iconography — a frightened person needs steadiness.
- It must be visually obvious that the game stopped. Someone mid-emergency needs help, not media literacy.

---

## 10. Layout & motion

- **Single column, mobile-first.** A max-width wrapper suffices on larger screens; reader column capped per §5.
- 4px base; 16px gutters; 12px between related elements, 24px between sections; 32px around the tell panel.
- Radius: 8px cards, 4px inputs, 16px bubbles, 22px chips, pill buttons (as built). No radius on printed cards — 3mm bleed and cut marks instead.
- **Motion near-zero.** 150ms fade on technique reveal, 120ms beat slide, one Lens pulse, one Mission Map unlock dissolve (§7.1). Nothing else. `prefers-reduced-motion` disables all of it.

---

## 11. Voice

- **Plain Burmese, short sentences.** Written for someone reading on a cracked screen in a hurry.
- **Name the technique, never the verdict.** "This uses fake urgency" — never "this is a scam," never a percentage. A copy rule as much as a product rule.
- **Never grade the person.** "Something here is designed to rush you," not "WRONG."
- **The Lens asks before it tells**, and admits what it can't know. Its refusal to give verdicts is the product's most differentiated behaviour — write it with confidence, never apology.
- **Mono is the honest voice.** When the interface speaks about its own limits, it speaks in mono.
- **Active voice, consistent verbs.** *Find the technique* produces *Technique found.*
- Bilingual order always **Burmese first, Latin gloss second** — app, deck, guide, and proposal screenshots.

---

## 12. Print parity

**Cards** — 63×88mm, 9 per A4, 3mm bleed, visible cut lines. **Must survive a black-and-white photocopier**, which is how the deck actually propagates in Myanmar: every technique carries a distinct **icon and pattern**, never colour alone. Test as pure greyscale before locking. Print face Padauk, embedded. Card back: flat `--forest` with the mark. Ship an uncut, no-bleed A4 version for low-spec printers.

**Facilitator lesson pages** — one lesson, one A4 page: scenario, mechanism, the tell, two practice items, three discussion prompts. Single column, 11pt Padauk, 1.8 line-height. Track accent as a **greyscale header band with the track number**, never colour.

**Parity rule:** the printed deck is Table mode without a phone. If a game feature can't be played on paper, question whether it belongs in the game.

---

## 13. Accessibility floor

- Touch targets ≥44px, 48px preferred. Lens chips and the corner magnifier included.
- Visible keyboard focus everywhere (`2px --forest`, 2px offset).
- Whole flow operable by screen reader; technique chips are real checkboxes with labels, not styled divs. The Lens sheet traps focus and returns it to the magnifier on close.
- Text resizes to 200% without loss of function — **no fixed-height containers in the lesson reader or the Lens sheet**, the two likeliest places to break this.
- Beat and round progress are real lists with `aria-current` on the active step.
- Assume **low digital literacy, not low intelligence**: label by what things do (*Find the technique*), never by system concept (*Analyze input*).

---

## 14. Do not

- Do not show a risk score, percentage, confidence bar, or threat level — anywhere, including the Lens.
- **Do not let the Lens state that something is true, false, fake, or a scam**, or claim to detect AI generation. Its refusal is the feature.
- Do not label anything "AI" unless a model produced it. The offline checklist is a checklist and says so.
- **Do not use warning triangles, sirens, shields, or padlocks** — security-console iconography frightens this audience and misframes the product as cybersecurity rather than media literacy. *(This includes locked-level states in Play — see §7.1 for the non-padlock alternative.)*
- Do not let Build output be copyable, exportable, or shareable, ever. *("Carry it" is the sole intentional exception, and looks nothing like it.)*
- Do not add badges, streaks, points, timers, or duration estimates. (General test: §3.1.)
- **Do not let a lesson end without launching a real game round.**
- **Do not let a lesson be video-only.** Text is always the complete path.
- Do not let the modules diverge in vocabulary, scenario pool, or progress model.
- Do not make green mean "correct" — green is the brand, so it can't also be a signal.
- Do not add a fourth core colour, a second display face, or a decorative illustration style without removing something first.
- **Do not swap the core palette or the mascot character on any single screen** — a themed sub-world stays in the brand's own dialect (§7.1); a palette/character swap is a brand substitution, not a theme.

---

## 15. Open

1. **Native-speaker review** of six technique names, six tells, all lesson bodies, and the Lens honesty script — **blocking** for app and print.
2. Burmese names for the three modules and for the Lens. They must feel like parts of one object, not four apps.
3. Icon set: draw six custom marks, or subset a licensed open set? Custom is ~half a day and guarantees the greyscale-photocopy test passes. *(Extends to the 3 Mission Map platform icons, §7.1 — same exercise, same session.)*
4. Confirm the display face licence permits self-hosting and subsetting.
5. Landing-page copy: **"nothing is uploaded" stops being true once the Lens makes API calls.** Revise before launch — an inaccurate privacy claim costs more with this audience than a caveated one.
6. Does the deck need a Shan or Mon variant for the pilot region, or is Burmese sufficient for v1?
